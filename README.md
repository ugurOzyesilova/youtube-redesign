A redesign of the popular video sharing platform, YouTube. Using React and the YouTube v3.1 API from RapidAPI, I was able to create a feature-rich and user-friendly experience that makes it easy for users to find and enjoy their favorite videos.

One of the main goals of my redesign was to enhance the way users discover and engage with video content. With this in mind, I added a number of new features including video categorization, video liking, search functionality, and the ability to view similar videos.

The ability to categorize videos makes it easy for users to find the content they are looking for, while the "like" feature allows users to save their favorite videos for easy access later on. Search functionality allows users to easily find videos by keyword or phrase, and the similar videos feature suggests related content to the user based on their viewing history.

I also wanted to give users the ability to personalize the look and feel of the platform to their liking, so I added a theme change functionality. This not only improves the overall aesthetic of the platform but also makes the user experience more enjoyable.
